    //  What are variables for?
    //      They keep track of stuff - color, number, shape, time, weight, how many, how far
    //  without them your software does nothing
    //      Try counting your fingers without numbers
    //      Try describing crayon without mentioning the color
    //      Try telling the police about a robber without mentioning the robbers height, gender, clothing
    //      Try giving creating your grocery list without numbers or nouns

    //      A Variable holds the data your application needs.
    //          It has two parts
    //          The name and the type
    //          Name - this is the tag your code will use to find the data when it is needed
    //              start with a lower case letter make it descriptive.
    //              you can use numbers also but just not as the first letter
    //              F_If you use multiple words then capitalize them (just not the first word)
    //          Type - this piece of information your code needs... what kind of info is it
    //              is it a whole number? we can use int or long
    //              is it a number with a decimal? We can use float or double
    //              is it text? we can use String
    //              is it tru or false? we can use boolean

    //      let's try some
    //      you need to count the students in the class
            int studentCount;
            int cntStudents;

    //      you are developing a football application and need to track the teams
    //      google football statistics and describe other data you find
            int     down;           //  1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
            int     toGoInDown;     //  yards to go in the down
            float   time;           //  time left in the quarter;
            float   avgYardsPerCarry;
            String  playersName;
            String  playersPosition;

    //      you are giving someone a description of the desk you want to buy
            int     width, height, length;
            String  color, style, woodFinish;

    //      Create 10 variables that could be used in the above studies
    //          create some int and longs
    //          create some true and false
